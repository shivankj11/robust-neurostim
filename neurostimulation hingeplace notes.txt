try diff ratios of length and conductivities
compare actual results to predicted results, quantify error wrt changes in params
try coding up robust version of optimization
try hingeplace
try link in bookmarks



next steps:
	change each conductivity randomly & independently
	try Chaitanya's version of Tau
	find out if there is only a multiplicative factor variation of Tau w.r.t. l or is there mistake in code

Started by deriving Tau for N=3
Wrote script for simulating tau under perturbation to conductivities for 3 layers of spherical model

Intro:


https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9630436

Hingeplace can help by exploiting the threshold activation property of neurons to find more optimal
electrode placements and currents which does not hold the electric field to 0 outside the 'focus'
region where activation is wanted, but holding the electric field to below some activation threshold.

As expected, the algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art, which optimizes with a constraint
which holds field outside focus region ('cancel' region) to 0 when the threshold is higher.


Questions:
- how are neural activation thresholds determined? is it something we have knowledge about and if so, could we formulate the
problem w/ this in mind?
- what are the downsides to smaller currents that don't end up activating neurons?
- waveforms?
- how does DCM produce configurations s.t. 
I will need to do some background reading on how we can produce more concentrated-looking current, such as which the DCM placement solutions produce, without bleeding out significantly outside of a certain region. I'm guessing that the fields produced by the electrodes can cancel out.


Description:
Investigating feasibility of incorporating robust optimization into previous work regarding formulization for optimization of 
electrode placement for neurostimulation

1 background understanding
2 given Ac / Af have errors, how to deal w/ them?
T has error - not perfect. For TI = E, how can we optimize robustly?
Error within a range.
